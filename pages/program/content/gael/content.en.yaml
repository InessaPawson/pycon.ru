title: Building a cutting-edge data processing environment on a budget
description: |
   As a penniless academic I wanted to do "big data" for science. Open
   source, Python, and simple patterns were the way forward. Staying on top
   of todays growing datasets is an arm race. Data analytics machinery
   —clusters, NOSQL, visualization, Hadoop, machine learning, ...— can
   spread a team's resources thin. Focusing on simple patterns, lightweight
   technologies, and a good understanding of the applications gets us most
   of the way for a fraction of the cost. These patterns appear underline
   the design of Mayavi, for interactive 3D visualization, scikit-learn, for
   easy machine learning, and joblib for out-of-core and parallel computing.
   
   I will present a personal perspective on ten years of scientific data
   processing with Python. What are the emerging patterns in data
   processing? How can modern data-mining ideas be used without a big
   engineering team? What constraints and design trade-offs govern software
   projects like scikit-learn, Mayavi, or joblib? How can we make the most
   out of distributed hardware with simple framework-less code?
