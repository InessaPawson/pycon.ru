title: "Micropython for arcade games and escaperooms"

description: |
    EscapeRoomMakers use Micropython for developing the last generation of escape rooms and arcade games. The modern escape room contains about 10 devices that communicate over a network with MQTT. Most of those devices are microcontrollers (ESP32) that control peripheral devices like mp3-players, relays, displays, diodes, buttons, etc. But a couple of years ago escape rooms had fewer devices, and the prevailing type of device was Arduino, which could communicate over several protocols.
    
    I will dedicate my speech to the forming of architecture that EscapeRoomMakers use for solving such problems with Micropython. All examples in the speech can be run on the popular microcontrollers by Espressif Systems.
