title: "Industrial Data Pipelines with Python and Airflow"

description: |
    This talk will provide a practical deep dive on how to build industry-ready machine learning / data pipelines using Airflow. This will consist of a practical presentation that will build from the basics of Airflow, and show how it is possible to build scalable and distributed machine learning data pipelines using a distributed architecture with a Celery backend. I will provide insights on some of the key learnings I've obtained throughout my career building & deploying machine learning systems in critical environments across several sectors.
