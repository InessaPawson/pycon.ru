title: "21st Century Software Testing"

description: |
   Software is everywhere, and it's full of bugs. 

   In order to fix bugs you need to find them. In order to find bugs in software, you need to test it.

   But there are so many bugs. How are we going to test for them all?

   Hypothesis is a modern software testing library that is here to help you out. You focus on the behaviour you want to test and let Hypothesis probe the boundary conditions of your software, automatically finding where those behaviours are violated.

   This is a talk by David R. MacIver, the primary author of Hypothesis. He'll talk about the challenges of good testing, and how Hypothesis can help you future-proof your software.
