title: "Asynchronous RabbitMQ driver from the author" 

description: |
    When I started writing Open Source library for communication with rabbitmq using asyncio I imagined creating simple and clear interface for everyone.
    Now it looks like a success, but it also took a while. This story is about me going deep into the driver (pika), fixing random bugs, writing my own driver, and trying not to break public API and not to "harm" users.
    What's missing in asyncio to implement network libraries without pain.
    The AMQP 0.9 design problems.
