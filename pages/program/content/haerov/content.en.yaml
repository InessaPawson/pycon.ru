title: "Python dev environment in 2k18"

description: |
     For years I’ve coexisted with various setups for a Python development environment, and never really found something I loved – until now.
     I've heard many stories about problems of setting up a fresh environment in different fields - from web development to data science.
     I'm going to talk about different pieces - conda, pyenv, pipenv, and pipsi and joint experience with such tools. It’s probably a tad more complex that is ideal for most Python users, but for the things I need, it’s perfect. I truly believe that everyone can find something new and handy after my speech.
