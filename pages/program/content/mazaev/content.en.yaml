title: "How to maintain the consistency of the API in a micro-service architecture"

description: |
    I'll talk about how we manage a lot of microservices in CIAN and how we deal with the typical problems of their support - versioning and API consistency.
    How to control consistency with a CI system. How we use a code generation and swagger-schemes. 
    This talk will be useful for experienced developers who interested in microservice architecture.
