description: |
   Social phenomena is coming. We have lot’s of social applications that we are using every day, let’s say Facebook, twitter, Instagram. Lot’s of such kind apps based on social graph and graph theory. I would like to share my knowledge and expertise about how to work with graphs and build large social graph as engine for Social network using python and Graph databases. We'll compare SQL and NoSQL approaches for friends relationships.
