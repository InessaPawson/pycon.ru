    When you have several dozens of highloaded microservices on your hands, you will inevitably think about the performance of asynchronous applications.

    In my talk i'll cover
    
    — Typical problems and pitfalls in the python microservice framework development
    
    — Profiling of asynchronous applications
    
    — Fundamental differences in async tornado and async aiohttp
