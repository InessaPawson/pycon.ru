title: From __icontains to search
description: |
    Good search experience is about more than just finding matching substring, 
    and in this talk I would like to present how it actually works. We will build 
    out a model of a search engine and analyze the result - what sort of functionality 
    and characteristics will the resulting engine have? What features can we implement 
    on top of it?  

    Most of the talk will be generic but there will be some concrete examples from 
    Elasticsearch. At the end of the talk there will be time for questions regarding 
    anything search related.
