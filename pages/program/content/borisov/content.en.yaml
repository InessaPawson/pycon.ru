title: "A Flat Too Smart: IoT + Python + whatever"

description: |
    Let's face it: we are caught in a vicious loop of earning money and spending them to have some respite from earning them. Each hour that you spend on this leaves you a little bit less of a person. To add insult to the injury, that leaves you with less time to try something new, forcing you to console yourselves with creating yet more legacy code on Python 2.

    "Enough is enough!". With that thought in hand, I decided to fill my life with all the Python things trending on Twitter. Smart home! Python 3! Lambda! Async!

    The Idea is simple on the surface: create a simple data acquisition system for gathering meter readings and data from sensors using only Python (provided that makes sense) and other hyped-up things: MicroPython, asyncio, living in the cloud and Telegram bot for a good measure. Come and see what had been accomplished, what turned out to be a folly and what you can learn from this unholy mess.
