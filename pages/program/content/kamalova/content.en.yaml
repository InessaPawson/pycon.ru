title: "Chat bot architecture"

description: |
    In this talk, I will explore creating chatbots in Python. Topics will include:

    * Python libraries and frameworks doing lots of "boring" stuff for you: from API adapters to natural language processing and generation.
    * Adapting the chatbot for other messengers (and non-messengers alike).
    * Scalability and reliability issues, with a special focus on Telegram API.

    The talk is aimed for anyone interested in making chatbots for fun and profit. It may also serve as a showcase for doing natural language processing in Python.
