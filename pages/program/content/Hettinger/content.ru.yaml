title: "Thinking about Concurrency"

description: |
    Walk through two examples of threading and multiprocessing to illustrate rules and best practices for taking advantage of concurrency.

    - Processes versus threads
    - Fear and respect.  Methodology and Confidence
    - Role of testing and fuzzing
    - Race conditions and sequencing issues
    - Locks versus flags
    - Resource isolation and atomic message queues
    - Sequencing by placing tasks in one thread
    - Barriers that wait for parallel threads to complete
    - Monitoring progress of daemon threads
    - Thread local variables versus global state
    - Advantages and disadvantages of processes
    - Parallelizable tasks versus intrinsically sequential tasks
    - Performance killers, the three most common mistakes
