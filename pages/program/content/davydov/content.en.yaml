title: "Serverless + Python using AWS Lambda as an example"

description: |
    Nowadays the most tech way to deploy web apps is using Docker containers. Usually to manage containers' cluster company needs special people â€” DevOps.
    A couple of years ago the new technology called Serverless was released. This technology almost completely illuminates devops layer and allows developers to easily deploy their apps with a focus on business logic.
    Using concept FAAS (function-as-a-service) Serverless is capable of provisioning not only MVPs' and prototypes but also high load [services](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-we-serve-25m-api-calls-from-10-scalable-global-endpoints-for-150-a-month-911002703280) with tiny costs. 

    The talk will cover core aspects of developing Serverless apps, costs, top market solutions and a short live demo with AWS Lambda at the end of the presentation. The talk will be useful for startups, small to medium businesses who'd like to optimize costs for development and time-to-production for new products.
