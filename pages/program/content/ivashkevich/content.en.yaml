title: "Julia, Python and machine learning"

description: |
    Progress in machine learning and deep learning is blazingly fast, as new architectures emerge and shift in hardware for neural networks training and inference is on its way.

    With these changes in landscape, Python is challenged by younger and more suitable languages. We will discuss one of Python contenders: Julia.

    Julia was designed as a high performance, JIT compiled language for technical computing, and offers first-class metaprogramming facilities and interoperability with C and Python. We will explore the basics of Julia, and what it offers for machine learning and whether it worth a try if you're a data scientist.
