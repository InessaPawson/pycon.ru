title: "Machine Learning in Web Scraping and Web Crawling"

description: |
    Everyone knows how to do web scraping and web crawling with Python: download and automate web pages using Scrapy / Selenium / requests; extract structured information with XPath, CSS, BeautifulSoup selectors or regular expressions. But this approach falls short when you want to extract information from millions of websites; just rules and heuristics can't get you there. 

    So, the talk is about applications of Machine Learning in web scraping and web crawling tasks:

    * how to classify web pages;
    * how to make computers "understand" page elements: html forms, pagination, etc.;
    * how to extract structured information from a web page;
    * how to create smart crawlers which doesn't download unnecessary content: duplicates, off-topic pages.

    I'll use examples from my practice to illustrate the solutions, describe applications of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning in web crawling and web scraping, and point to various Open Source components for creating "smart" web spiders.
